# Recommendation-System-in-Python-

This repository contains the implementation of a recommendation system using Python. It includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation to provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.

## Repository Contents

- **datos:** Contains the dataset used for building the recommendation system, specifically the "lastfm-dataset-360K".
- **Notas_sobre_datos.txt:** Notes and observations regarding the dataset, including preprocessing steps and insights.
- **Practica.html:** HTML version of the notebook for viewing the code and results.
- **Practica.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the recommendation system, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Highlight: `Practica` Folder

The `Practica` folder (represented by Practica.ipynb and Practica.html) is the core component of this repository, featuring:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Steps to load and preprocess the Last.fm dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis and visualization of the dataset to understand user behavior and preferences.
- **Model Building:** Implementation of various recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and methods to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.
